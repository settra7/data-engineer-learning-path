## Day 7 â€” Mini-project in the portfolio

### About

Project: **ETL from CSV to DB.**

This project is part of my self-study. The assignments I do are part of my curriculum that I get from ChatGPT.
*I do not use ChatGPT to do the assignments*, I only use it for educational purposes and to get the assignments.

I'm getting my datasets from *Kaggle*.
